# 📄 Sprint 2 - Navigation & Scrollable Content

## 🎯 Sprint Goal
- Enhance the portfolio website by improving navigation, adding a sidebar for quick project access, and making the main content scrollable.

---

## 🛠️ Tasks

🧭 Navigation Tabs  
- Add a top navigation bar with tabs:  
  - `Home`, `About`, `Blog`, `Projects`  
- Use `<nav>` tags for semantic structure.

📑 Side Panel  
- Add a side panel (toggleable) to quickly switch between "Fast Projects".  
- Include a button to show/hide this panel.

📐 Layout & Structure  
- Improve the overall structure of the website layout.  
- Use more semantic and modular sections (like `<nav>`, `<aside>`, etc.).

🧾 Scrollable Main Content  
- Make the main content area scrollable independently from the rest of the page.  
- Ensure the footer is revealed only when the main content is fully scrolled.  
- Consider using a scroll box (`overflow-y: scroll`) for this behavior.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Navigation bar and side panel are functional.
- Main content scrolls independently and footer appears at scroll end.
- Structural improvements use semantic HTML tags.
- All changes are committed to version control (e.g., Git).

---

## 📅 Estimated Duration
- 1 - 1.5 day of focused development and testing.

---

## 📝 Notes
- Later improvements may include animations, responsiveness, and styling polish.
- Consider adding event listeners to detect scroll end and trigger footer visibility.
